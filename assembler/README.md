# HACK Assembler

## Overview

This project is part of the NAND2Tetris course, which aims to build a complete computer system from the ground up. The Hack Assembler translates Hack assembly language programs into Hack machine language (binary code).

## Features

* Translates Hack assembly language into machine code.
* Supports A-instructions (`@value` or `@symbol`).
* Supports C-instructions (`dest=comp;jump`).
* Recognizes predefined symbols.
* Handles user-defined labels and variable symbols.
* Ignores comments and whitespace in the assembly code.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x

## Usage

**Assembler input**: The assembler expects a text file containing Hack assembly code. Each line can be an instruction, a label, or a comment.

**Assembler output**: The output is a text file containing the binary machine code corresponding to the input assembly code. Each line of the output file is a 16-bit binary instruction.

**Running the assembler**: `python3 assembler.py filename.asm`

## Implementation Details

### Files

* **assembler.py**: The main assembler script.


### Functions

* **read_file(filename)**: Reads the input assembly file.
* **parse_lines(lines)**: Removes comments and whitespaces from the assembly code.
* **first_pass(lines)**: Creates the symbol table with label addresses.
* **second_pass(lines, symbol_table)**: Translates instructions into binary code.
* **translate_a_instruction(instruction)**: Translates A-instructions into binary.
* **translate_c_instruction(instruction)**: Translates C-instructions into binary.
* **write_file(filename, binary_code)**: Writes the binary code to the output file.

### Symbol Table

* **Predefined symbols**: R0 to R15, SCREEN, KBD, SP, LCL, ARG, THIS, THAT.
* **Label symbols**: User-defined labels marked with parentheses, e.g., (LOOP).
* **Variable symbols**: Dynamically assigned starting from address 16.

## Error Handling

This HACK assembler does NOT check for any errors in the assembly code. It is assumed that the assembly code is generated by the VM translator and is error-free.

## Testing

The assembler has been thoroughly tested with various HACK assembly codes:
* Simple programs with predefined symbols and comments.
* Programs with user-defined labels and variables.
* Complex programs with different instruction types.
